        <h1>Presentation part 2</h1>
        <p>- Disco's development often decentralizes the influence of Black individuals, particularly Black queer individuals.</p>
        <p>- Scholarly discussions often overlook the significant presence and contributions of Black queer communities in disco's origins and development.</p>
        <p>- Early disco was closely associated with cultural diversity, with many artists being Latinos or African Americans, and a diverse audience including urban straight and gay African Americans, Latinos, and white gay men.</p>
        <p>- Despite this diversity, scholarly narratives tend to universalize white gay experiences and overlook the contributions of Black queer communities.</p>    
        <p>- The emergence of disco was rooted in Black popular music traditions and technological innovations, particularly the transformation of beats and tempo by artists like MFSB.</p>
        <p>- DJs played a crucial role in disco's popularity, with the ability to transition between records and keep dancers on the floor, while also influencing the racial demographics of clubs through musical selection.</p>
        <p>- Racism and homophobia intersected in disco culture, leading to the establishment of Black gay networks within the scene, which fostered interactions and shared musical ideas.</p>
        <p>- The backlash against disco in the late 1970s, epitomized by events like "Disco Demolition Night," reflected a desire to reclaim white masculinity's dominance in mainstream music by rejecting dance music in favor of album-oriented rock.</p>
        <p>- This anti-disco sentiment further marginalized the contributions of Black queer communities to disco culture, highlighting the complex intersectionality of race, sexuality, and music.</p>
