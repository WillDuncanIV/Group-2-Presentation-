        <h1>Presentation part 1</h1>
        <p>- Macklemore’s “same love” and the discussion around Hip-Hop and LGBTQ+ rights in white communities have constructed a division of Black or gay.
        </p>
        <p>- Rap dance music styles are associated with Black and Latinx LGBTQ+ social spaces</p>
        <p>- A musical history shows that the genres of rap, disco, house, had a similar way to use technology with the pre-recorded sound and playback equipment (turntables and tape decks)
        </p>
        <p>- By reconsidering the genre’s growth and put it more close to the conversation with the music traditions that are associated with Black and Latinx queer club cultures is how Hip-Hop is repositioned into a Black queer musical and social lineage
        </p>
        <p>- The two groups that are associated with Black and Latinx LGBTQ+ subcultures are disco and house.</p>
        <p>- (The rise and fall of disco had quite a significance in queer space but the emergence of house music had a following homophobic and racist backlash against disco.)
        </p>
        <p>- By sharing music styles and techniques, Hip-Hop overlapped in spaces with disco and it put Black queer subcultures in proximity in the earliest Hip-Hop performances 
        </p>
        <p>- Some Hip-Hop participants began to distance themselves from disco which was a homophobic tendency to be able to separate the newest genre from that music style and any space that was associated with the LGBTQ+ community.
        </p>
        <p>- In mid- 2010s there was a very openly queer and trans rappers such as Big Freedia, Mykki Blanco, and Lil Nas X.
        </p>
        <p>- Hip-Hop evolved in music genres that began in queer spaces, mostly disco.
        </p>
        <p>- In the 1970s and 1980s, musical practices associated with queer socialities and queer spaces which connected Hip-Hop to queer cultures
        </p>
        <p>- Rapper Chuck D said he does not like house music b/c its sophisticated, anti-black, anti-culture, anti-feel, and that it represents the gay scene and it is separating blacks from their past and culture
        </p>
        <p>- Scholars have acknowledged that the birth of disco could be traced in NYC at the end of the 1960s and beginning of 1970s in the Black and gays clubs, but scholars have failed to acknowledge the Black queer influences on the genre
        </p>
        <p>- Disco was a musical movement in the 1970s and it played an important role in the social lives of people from many communities who were challenging their position in society
        </p>
        <p>- Disco began activists movements and Alice Echols notes, that disco evolved social movements
        </p>
        <p>- During the Great Migration in places like Chicago, Detroit, and NY, Black gay men and lesbian women would form social networks and institutions
        </p>
        <p>- Rent parties were important for Black queer individuals b/c it provided safety of privacy
        </p>
        <p>- Before the Stonewall riots in 1969, there was a pro-LGBTQ+ activism in the US, which led to private house parties which required an invitation, gay bars were limited in public spaces and these bars were frequently raid by the police which led to patrons arrests and their names being published on the newspaper
        </p>
        <p>- In the early 1970s gay-owned discos had a huge clientele in NYC but they were not muliracial and most of them, for example, “The Flamingo” would charge an expensive membership, and for that there would mostly be whites
        </p>
        <p>- It either you are Black or gay, not Black and gay
        </p>
        <p>- Early in the 1970s many of the disco artists were Latino or African Americans and many were African American women
